# This is me
I'm a guy who likes Python,as I always use it in my projects.\
But my real passion is gaming on microcontrollers like the RP2040.\
I personally call myself a "Python power user", but I use MicroPython more!
## Some insperations
- Vincent Mistler's [PicoGameBoy](https://www.youmaketech.com/raspberry-pi-pico-gameboy/)
- HalloSpaceBoy's [PicoBoy](https://picoboy.co/)\
Without their ideas, I'd be nothing!
## My Projects
Right now, I only have one:\
The [Gamer2040](https://github.com/Hamuza11/Gamer2040), but it's not yet for sale!\
You'll have to build it yourself.
